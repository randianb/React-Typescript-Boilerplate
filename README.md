# React Typescipt Boilerplate

React library using the following
- Typescript
- Parcel
- Auth0
- Prettier

## Running Locally
* Create a root `.env` file locally by using the `.env.example` file in the root directory as an example. Fill in needed variables with real values given to you by your peers (or shamelessly lifted from the Heroku config vars).
* Run `yarn` and `yarn dev` to create a local instance, which should default to running on port `1234`.
* Verify that your local instance is ALIVE in a browser by accessing `localhost:1234`.
